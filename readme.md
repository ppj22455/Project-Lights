(Report System)

Once you report someone, it sends a notification to us, if we check the issue as false reporting, the reporting account gets banned.

If you report someone and it sends us a notification about "Hate speech" or "Toxicity" we will investigate the chat logs.

If you report "Cheating" the offending player will be banned in 4-8 hours after the report was made.


NOTES ABOUT PLAYFAB WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD

Yes, we get your city and region, we do NOT have your IP's. We turned that setting off for privacy. 

If you get banned from your IP, we do not have it. We only have your USERID and Master Account ID.

IP Banning (What to expect)

Once you get IP banned, you will NOT be able to install the game again. You will be banned from the IP and if someone else in your home plays the game,
tell them to use a VPN, we are not un-IP banning you. (Dont be stupid)

Follow CODE OF CONDUCT, I can't say that enough. It's not hard, just do it.


Have fun.
